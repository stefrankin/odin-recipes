            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>

         <h3><em>Steps</em>:</h3>
         <ol>
            <li>Step 1: Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Step 2: Whisk egg in large mixing bowl. Add chicken, salt, sugar, and pepper; mix well. Mix in cornstarch, a 
                little bit at a time, until chicken is well coated.</li>

            <li>Step 3: Working in batches, carefully drop one piece of chicken at a time into the hot oil. Fry until chicken
                 turns golden brown and begins to float, about 3 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate and allow to cool as you fry the next batch.</li>

            <li>Step 4: Once all of the chicken has been fried, refry the chicken, starting with the batch that was cooked first.
                 Fry each batch until chicken turns deep golden brown, about 2 minutes more. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Step 5: Prepare sauce: Heat vegetable oil in a wok or large skillet over high heat. 
                Stir in green onion, garlic, whole chiles, and orange zest. Cook and stir until garlic turns golden and chiles brighten, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Step 6: Add sugar, soy sauce, chicken broth, peanut oil, rice vinegar, sesame oil, and ginger; bring to a boil and cook for 3 minutes.
                 Whisk 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in water until dissolved. Stir into the boiling sauce. Return to a boil and cook until the sauce thickens
                  and is no longer cloudy from the cornstarch, about 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Step 7: Stir chicken into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to low and cook until chicken is heated through
                 and has absorbed some of the sauce, about 3 minutes.</li>
